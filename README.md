Pytorch is an open-source deep learning framework available with a Python and C++ interface. Pytorch resides inside the torch module. In PyTorch, the data, that has to be processed, is input in the form of a tensor. The torch package contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and defines mathematical operations over these tensors. Additionally, it provides many utilities for efficient serializing of Tensors and arbitrary types, and other useful utilities.
